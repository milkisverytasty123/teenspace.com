It has an important role on Earth, such as: reflects sunlight at night to prevent us from darkness; creates the tides; as well as it keep earth from rotating fast, and if the moon wasn't there our day would be in minutes rather than hours. In conclusion, the moon play an important role for the Earth. </h4></b>

<i><h2 id="color-name"; style="text-align: center">FORMATION</h2></i></b>
   <h3 id="color"; style="text-align:center"> Now the most important thing to know before you introduce your self to some facts about the moon, is to know how it was formed. Long ago; around 4 billion years, the earth was still just born, what is most widely accepted today is the giant-impact theory. It proposes that the Moon formed during a collision between the Earth and another small planet, about the size of Mars. The debris from this impact collected in an orbit around Earth to form the Moon.

<h3 id="color"; style="text-align:center"> Earth's rotation speed just right for our fellas. But as the earth rotates, the bulge raised on its surface by the Moon's gravity is always a little ahead of the Moon rather than directly under it. The Moon pulls back on the bulge, and in the process it slows the whole planet down.</h3>

<div class="Earth">
   <h2 id="Earth"><b> Previously, we talked about about our fellow neighboor, the Moon. But now its time to talk about our green home. In this part, we will talk about: how the Earth was born; and some other important things about our green planet.</b></h2>
</div>
<body>
   <h2 id="color-name"; style="text-align:center"><b><i> FORMATION: </i></b></h2>
   <h3 id="color"; style="text-align: center">When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. It was said that the temperetures were so high, that rocks would melt. There was basically oceans of lava and magma on every single cubed km on the planet. But, you may ask:"HoW WerE tHe OceANS formED?" That takes us to the second point in this part.
   </h3>
   <h2 id="color-name"; style="text-align:center"><b><i>THE EARTH'S COOLDOWN PART-1:</i></b></h2>
<h3 id="color"; style="text-align:center"> The sun has warmed the surface during the day.
   Once the sun goes down, the earth's surface will begin to cool (energy emitted is greater than energy received). This causes the earth's surface to become progressively cooler during the night... But how did the oceans form? </h3>
<h2 id="color-name"; style="text-align:center"><b><i>THE EARTH'S COOLDOWN PART-2:</i></b></h2>
<h3 id="color"; style="text-align:center">After the Earth started cooling down, a meteor shower occured (meteor shower: more than 100 meteors strinking Earth in the same second), the Earth was back to its old habbit. But these meteors came with a life changing event; literally. These meteors had small atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, and many other elements to make Earth sustainable for life. After that, the earth cooled down the same way it did, but this time, the hydrogen and oxygen had risen to the atmosphere to make rain, and eventually created what we know tody as 'The Oceans'.  </h3>
<h2 id="color-name"; style="text-align: center"><b><i> SALTY OCEANS:
</i></b></h2>
<h3 id="color"; style="text-align:center"> How oceans became salty is a pretty easy question to be answered,Salt in the ocean comes from two sources: runoff from the land and openings in the seafloor. Rocks on land are the major source of salts dissolved in seawater. Rainwater that falls on land is slightly acidic, so it erodes rocks.
</h3>
<h2 id="color-name"; style="text-align: center;"><b><i>TSUNAMIS:</i></b></h2>
<h3 id="color"; style="text-align:center"> Tsunamis are one of the hardest, and toughest natural phenominas. Tsunami is a large series of waves thta are higher that 25 meters. These usually are formed due to: Earth-quakes, under water volcanoes, asteroid impact, and volcanoes; no like the normal volcanoes above water.</h3>
<h2 id="color-name"; style="text-align: center"><b><i> Earth-quakes: </h2></b></i>
<h3 id="color"; style="text-align: center"> So we talked about tsunamis and how they are caused, but one of those causes were Earth-quakes. But how are Earth-quakes caused. So Earth-quakes are caused due to tectonic plate movement; (tectonic plates: they are layers of magma under the ground.) But these tectonic plates are moved due to magma movement. But these aren't the only cause, asteroid impacts are also a cause. Or a large explosion equivilant to an asteroid impact. </h3>
<h2 id="color-name"; style="text-align: center"><b><i> volcanoes: </h2></b></i>
<h3 id="color"; style="text-align: center"> Volcanoes are basically extremly dangerous mountains. A volcano is formed when hot molten rock, ash and gases escape from an opening in the Earth's surface. The molten rock and ash solidify as they cool, forming the distinctive volcano shape shown here. As a volcano erupts, it spills lava that flows downslope. Hot ash and gases are thrown into the air. But how does it erupt. </h3>
<h2 id="color-name"; style="text-align: center"><b><i> Volcano Eruptions: </b></i></h2>
<h3 id="color"; style="text-align: center"> Volcanoes erupt when molten rock called magma rises to the surface. Magma is formed when the earth's mantle melts. Melting may happen where tectonic plates are pulling apart or where one plate is pushed down under another. Magma is lighter than rock so rises towards the Earth's surface. Isn't complicated right. </h3>
